Agathis Management Controller (MC) CLI specification.

== Assumptions

  * the CLI is normally accessed by connecting to the service port
  * the user of this interface has a service profile (can change configuration, no access to data links)
  * the first service user (default service user) is the test engineer on the production line of the module
//  * the default service user does not need any credentials to get the MC (TMC or MMC) to answer
//  * the default service user credentials can be changed in the field by an admin (first customer) accessing the Agathis system/stack from a data link
  * the prompt line displays the MC id (MAC address)
  * commands are organized hierarchically
