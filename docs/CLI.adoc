Agathis Management Controller (MC) CLI specification.

== Assumptions

  * the CLI is normally accessed by connecting to the service port
  * the user of this interface has a service profile (can change configuration, no access to data links)
  * the first service user (default service user) is the test engineer on the production line of the module
//  * the default service user does not need any credentials to get the MC (TMC or MMC) to answer
//  * the default service user credentials can be changed in the field by an admin (first customer) accessing the Agathis system/stack from a data link
  * the prompt line displays the MC id (MAC address)
  * commands are organized hierarchically

== Built-in Commands

=== pwd

Shows the current hierarchy level (path)

=== ls

List commands available in the current level

=== cd

Change the command hierarchy level (path)

== Command Levels

The commands are organized in the following levels:

  * (root) - commands for the local MC
    ** <<cmd_root_info>>
    ** <<cmd_root_set>>
    ** <<cmd_root_cfg>>
  * mod - commands for other MCs
    ** <<cmd_mod_info>>
    ** <<cmd_mod_id>>
    ** <<cmd_mod_reset>>
    ** <<cmd_mod_on>>
    ** <<cmd_mod_off>>
